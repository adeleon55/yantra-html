The image is like a portal to a universe, a dimension, a state of mind or an energy. Yantras have been used for thousands of years for meditation.

Mysteriously, reoccurring mathematical proportions for example the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio appear everywhere around us. <br>They are displayed in the proportions of flower petals, animal horns, in the human body, in crystals, in star constellations, in molecular design, and in physics. <br>Humans are drawn to, and find an innate beauty in these proportions.  <br><br>As there are infinite dimensions in the universe, humans have been able to depict these energies via many geometrical designs. For example – the energy of dissolution, away from the physical into the spiritual (as associated with Shiva) is depicted by an upward pointing triangle, in front of a downward pointing triangle. Another example is the Flower of Life which depicts the energy of the creation of the universe.It’s made up of 19 inter connected and overlapping circles. Another example is the Kalachakra mandala, another yantra which depicts the universe of the BuddhaKalachakra, and conveys the energy of enlightenment, of going beyond time andspace. <br><br>The yantra found here is the <strong>Sri Yantra</strong> – the Holy Yantra – also known as the highest yantra. This sacred diagram is formed of nine interlocking triangles with a bindu or a dot in the center. This yantra depicts the energy which holds the entire cosmos, it depicts the union of yin and yang.This diagram is magical, it holds secret teachings and can carry you to connect with infinity, with all things beneficial, with power, love, beauty, abundance and knowledge. </p>     </div>   </div>   <div class="section-2">     <div class="container-4 w-container"><a href="#" class="button-2 w-button">Go Back to Home</a></div>   </div>   <div class="container-3 w-container">     <h1 class="heading-5">How to Use the Yantra</h1>     <p class="paragraphtext">1. Place the yantra in front of you.  Make sure that the yantra is placed the right way, not upside down. The triangle with the dot in the middle should face down.<br><br>2.    Be sure to position the yantra so that when you look at the diagram, from your sitting position, your head is held straight ahead and you are not looking with your head tilted up or down. You may want to use the yantra by hanging it on a wall at just the right height so that when you face the wall and stare at the image, your head is held straight.<br><br>3.    It is essential that you keep your head at a straight angleduring meditation so that the kundalini energy that is unlocked during meditation can move up your chakras freely.<br><br>4.    During meditation, simply gaze gently at the bindu (the dot inthe middle of the interlocking triangles). Keep gazing gently at the bindu during your meditation period.<br><br>If your eyes get tired you can close your eyes for a few seconds then reopen them and come right back to gazing gently at the diagram. If you grow tired of focusing on the bindu in the center, you can focus on the diagram in its entirety, or focus on a specific set of interconnected triangles that jump out at you.   <br><br>During yantra meditation, you may experience phenomenon. The triangles may start to move, or a set of triangles may appear to pop out or change colors compared to the others.The wall surrounding the diagram, the entire room may start to turn colors. You may feel sensations in your body. You might find yourself feeling happy and full of energy. Whatever happens, keep your head held straight ahead and keep focusing gently on the yantra.       <br><br>A yantra is like a machine - it&#x27;s constantly emitting the energy it&#x27;s associated with. Therefore, it&#x27;s a good idea to display the sri yantra in your home at all times, as it will bring positive energy into your space. For example, it&#x27;s a good idea to keep the yantra displayed in your meditation area even when you are not using it for meditation practice. <br><br> ~Enjoy </p>   </div>   <div class="section-2">     <div class="container-4 w-container"><a href="#" class="button-2 w-button">Go Back to Home</a></div>   </div>   <script src="https://d1tdp7z6w94jbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>   <script src="js/webflow.js" type="text/javascript"></script>   <!-- [if lte IE 9]><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif] --> </body>  </html>
