                        <p>1. Place the yantra in front of you. Make
                                sure that the yantra is placed the right
                                way, not upside down.The triangle with
                                the dot in the middle should face down.</p>       
                        <p>2. Be sure to position the yantra so that
                                when you look at the diagram, from your
                                sitting position, your head is held straight
                                ahead and you are not looking with your
                                head tilted up or down.You may want to
                                use the yantra by hanging it on a wall at
                                just the right height so that when you
                                face the wall and stare at the image,
                                your head is held straight.</p>       
                        <p>3. It is essential that you keep your head
                                at a straight angle during meditation so
                                that the kundalini energy that is
                                unlocked during meditation can move
                                up your chakras freely.</p>       
                        <p>4. During meditation, simply gaze gently
                                at the bindu (the dot in the middle of the
                                interlocking triangles). Keep gazing
                                gently at the bindu during your
                                meditation period.       
                        <p>If your eyes get tired you can close your
                                eyes for a few seconds then reopen them
                                and come right back to gazing gently at
                                the diagram.      
                        <p>If you grow tired of focusing on the bindu
                                in the center, you can focus on the
                                diagram in its entirety, or focus on a
                                specific set of interconnected triangles
                                that jump out at you.</p>      
                        <p>During yantra meditation, you may
                                experience phenomenon.The triangles
                                may start to move, or a set of triangles
                                may appear to pop out or change colors
                                compared to the others.The wall
                                surrounding the diagram, the entire room
                                may start to turn colors.You may feel
                                sensations in your body.You might find
                                yourself feeling happy and full of energy.
                                Whatever happens, keep your head held
                                straight ahead and keep focusing gently
                                on the yantra.</p>
                        <p>A yantra is like a machine - it's constantly
                                emitting the energy it's associated with.
                                Therefore, it's a good idea to display the
                                sri yantra in your home at all times,as it
                                will bring positive energy into your space.
                                For example, it's a good idea to keep the
                                yantra displayed in your meditation area
                                even when you are not using it for meditation practice.</p>
