                    <p>A yantra is a mystical diagram,a
            geometric depiction of a universal truth.
            The image is like a portal to a universe,a
            dimension,a state of mind or an energy.
            Yantras have been used for thousands of
            years for meditation.Yantras are an
            excellent tool for developing
            concentration.</p>

                    <p>A yantra is a mystical diagram,a

            The image is like a portal to a universe,a
            dimension,a state of mind or an energy.
            Yantras have been used for thousands of
            years for meditation.Yantras are an
            excellent tool for developing
            concentration.</p>

                    <p>Yantra meditation is very powerful.These
            sacred diagrams can carry us into higher
            states of mind, to experience higher
            understandings and sacred energies.</p>

                    <p>Science has proven that everything in
            our world is based on geometry.
            Mysteriously,reoccurring mathematical
            proportions for example the Fibonacci
            Sequence and the Golden Ratio appear
            everywhere around us.They are
            displayed in the proportions of flower
            petals,animal horns, in the human body,
            in crystals, in star constellations, in
            molecular design,and in physics.
            Humans are drawn to,and find an innate
            beauty in these proportions.
            As there are infinite dimensions in the
            universe, humans have been able to
            depict these energies via many
            geometrical designs. For example – the
            energy of dissolution,away from the
            physical into the spiritual (as associated
            with Shiva) is depicted by an upward
            pointing triangle, in front of a downward
            pointing triangle.Another example is the
            Flower of Life which depicts the energy of
            the 12 of the universe. It’s made up of 19
            interconnected and overlapping circles.
            Another example is the Kalachakra
            mandala,another yantra which depicts
            the universe of the Buddha Kalachakra,
            and conveys the energy of
            enlightenment, of going beyond time
            and space.</p>

                    <p>The yantra found here is the Sri Yantra –
            the Holy Yantra – also known as the
            highest yantra.This sacred diagram is
            formed of nine interlocking triangles with
            a bindu or a dot in the center.This yantra
            depicts the energy which holds the entire
            cosmos, it depicts the union of yin and
            yang.This diagram is magical, it holds
            secret teachings and can carry you to
            connect with infinity, with all things
            beneficial, with power, love,beauty,
            abundance and knowledge.</p>
